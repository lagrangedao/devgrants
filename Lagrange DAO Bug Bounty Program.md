## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in participating in our bug bounty program. As an AI dApp market space, [Lagrange DAO](https://lagrangedao.org/main) strives to provide a secure platform for developers and users to create and manage datasets, spaces, mint Data NFTs, and engage with the community, and we appreciate your assistance in identifying vulnerabilities!

## Scope
Our bug bounty program covers the following areas of the Lagrange DAO:

- [Datasets](https://lagrangedao.org/dataset)
- [Models](https://lagrangedao.org/models)
- [Spaces](https://lagrangedao.org/spaces)
- Setting
- Network]
- [What else?]

We encourage you to focus your efforts on the areas where you believe there may be the greatest risk of vulnerabilities. Please do not attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.


## Eligibility

Anyone is eligible to participate in the bug bounty program, except employees of our organization and their immediate family members. 
## Rewards

The rewards for valid vulnerabilities will be determined on a case-by-case basis, based on the **severity and impact** of the vulnerability. The severity is calculated according to the OWASP risk rating model based on Impact on the Lagrange DAO and Likelihood. *[View OWASP method](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology)*.

| Severity Level | Description | Examples | Rewards |
| :----------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Critical | Can cause serious problems if are not fixed | Potential to remote code execution, result in the loss of users funds, smart contracts abuse, etc. | Up to [how much?] [USD/LAD?] | 
| High | Significantly impact the platform security or functionality but may have some limitation in terms of exploitability or potential damage | Bypassing platform restrictions, manipulation of platform features        | Up to [how many?] LAD] |
| Medium | Limited threat to the platform or users with a relatively lower impact on security or functionality | Information disclosure, minor logic flaws in smart contracts, or other security risks that require specific conditions to be exploited        | Up to [how many?] LAD |
| Low | - Minimal risk that may require extensive effort to exploit; <br> - Minor impact on the platform security | Issues that could cause inconvenience, bad UX, etc. | Up to [how many?] LAD |
| Informational | Informational or improvement reports | Suggestions for optimizing the platforms performance, security practices, or improving UX, smart contract code qualities, data handling practices etc. | Up to [how many?] LAD |

:exclamation: <span style="color:red">Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to fix it.</span>

## Legal

We will not take legal action against anyone for reporting a vulnerability, as long as they have acted in good faith and have not exploited the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.

We will not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from participation in the bug bounty program.
We reserve the right to modify the terms of the bug bounty program at any time.
